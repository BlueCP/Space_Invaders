1) https://pypi.org/project/vgamepad/#xbox360-gamepad -- Idea to control game using fpga -> generates a virtual controller -> needs testing tho
 this should allow us to control pretty much any game using the fpga
 (limitted to 2 directions and 2 buttons (like a shit nes controller))

2) this allows for us to test the game using controllers without having to leave testing till last (modular testing)

3) xinput/dinput apis for unity (other things are available)?

4) uses stuff from lab 4 to send the readings from board to base

5) written in python
