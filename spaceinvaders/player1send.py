#script for if we are using pygame
#this script will be run on the client side, and will send data to the server
#this script will be modified based on which computer it is running on - player 1's , or player 2's
#this version is for player 1

#variables are defined in game code, which this script will have access to
#i have predicted following variables: btn_press, x_position, user_score, user_lives
#there will be more which i can easily add or remove unnecessary variavles



    #concanete all the data into one string called user1dat

    #wait a small while before sending more data. this will send info about users actions 10 times per second.
